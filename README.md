Dreamhost Basic Simple PHPMailer Contact Form

I have created a basic PHPMailer form that can be used as a starting template for developers working with DreamHost. This form can be used to send emails from websites hosted on DreamHost servers. It's a simple and easy-to-use template for anyone looking to implement email functionality on their DreamHost-hosted website.

* Must use Dreamhost email

I will have additional updates with Gmail Templates :)
